We\\'ve found that both candidates with traditional CS backgrounds as well as others who are self-taught or freelancers can excel at our company.</p>\\n<p>We\\'re not interested in hiring for any particular niche skill at the moment. Rather, we like to engage with engineers who have a well rounded and full stack background, either for web or mobile. If you feel particularly strong in one skill though, we still would like to talk.</p>\\n<h2>More About The Role</h2>\\n<p>As an engineer at our company, you\\'ll work directly with our CTO and Creative Director and other engineers on a variety of software projects covering different programming languages, frameworks, and application architectures.</p>\\n<p>The single best reason to be an engineer at our company is because of the exposure to different programming languages, technologies and client projects.</p>\\n<p>Typical client work includes building any of the following: web and mobile apps, public and private API\\'s, static sites and CMS platforms, e-commerce sites like Shopify stores, and digital transformation projects with enterprise clients.</p>\\n<p>For more information about how we run our Sprints and manage our SDLC, read <a href=\"https://lightmatter.com/playbook/\">our company Playbook</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Specific Qualifications</h2>\\n<p>Ideally, you have experience with the following:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p>You have 2+ years working as a software engineer at another agency, a product focused startup, or an enterprise company.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>You have spent some time freelancing independently, whether as a side hustle or full time. Almost everyone on our team has been an individual freelancer at one point, and understands the value of all the “work” outside of the actual deliverable for the client: excellent communication, professionalism, punctuality and follow through.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>You have 0 ego with regards to your code, can both receive and offer feedback positively, and are willing to pair and help others as develop software alongside you.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>You\\'re a self-starter. You\\'re not afraid to take initiative, but know when and how to check with others to ensure you\\'re making the right decision. You can balance the technically correct and/or more elegant solution with what the client wants (which often differs) and can do this quickly.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>You\\'re not afraid to ship code! We don\\'t care if it\\'s not done yet. Push it up and get feedback!</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Our company does not offer equity as we’re not a venture backed startup.

You’ll help us redesign the way the data is organized in the schema, you’ll denormalize to the right level based on proper design strategy,  and you’ll mentor the developers in the right way to insert, update and query the repository.</p>\\n<p>This is an e-commerce production database; you’re the kind of person that can help us make that DB scream with speed for all of the complex dataflows we have, and teach the rest of the engineering team how they should use that database for optimal transaction processing.</p>\\n<p>The Impact You Will Make Here</p>\\n<p>● You’ll redesign the RDBMS platform for all of our e-commerce transactions, guiding developers in best ways to query, insert, update and delete with efficiency and at scale</p>\\n<p>● You’ll dig into denormalizing our DB and get it properly balanced between physical footprint and being built for speed</p>\\n<p>● You’ll work with operations DBAs to redesign for fault tolerance, replication, and (the biggie) AWS regionalization as we go international with our platform.</p>\\n<p>● You’ll help us get the business logic out of the database (we have too many stored procedures) and get it back into the codebase where it belongs</p>\\n<p>● You’ll figure out what should be in the database and what shouldn’t (we have Redis, Elasticsearch, and Mongo repositories ready to take what shouldn’t be in the RDBMS; but we need your guidance in pulling those data elements out of your DB)</p>\\n<p>● You’ll employ every trick in the book to get our database fault tolerant, performant, and scalable to go from hundreds of millions of inventory items to over 50 billion.</p>\\n<p>What You Bring To The Team</p>\\n<p>● You are a senior, deeply experienced RDBMS professional with 11+ years of practical experience or equivalent (BS, MS)</p>\\n<p>● You’re an expert with SQL, and RDBMS Technologies such as MS SQL Server, Oracle, or Postgres</p>\\n<p>● We’re in AWS, so expertise in working with cloud-hosted databases and associated storage options is essential. Replication across regions and availability zones is a big deal as we explode with growth here.</p>\\n<p>● You can discriminate between data that belongs in an RDBMS, and data that is better suited to a NoSQL DB, or an Elasticsearch implementation, or a Redis (cached key-value-pair-type DB).</p>\\n<p>● Capable of reading/walking through code in a higher level language. Most of our code is in C#, some in Go and some in Clojure. You’re not going to be a developer, but being able to walk them through some embedded SQL in their language of choice will be important.</p>\\n<p>What We Provide</p>\\n<p>Our benefits program is one of the most flexible and progressive in the country.

We code, write tests, review, discuss and refactor if needed. We don’t just spit out features and move on to the next thing. We automate things wherever we can and throw out stuff we no longer need. In the long run, quality equals speed. Some data you may be interested in: we have a Java backend, Angular/Typescript frontend.

There's plenty of opportunities to educate yourself through online training, attending conferences and trying out new stuff during our annual hackathon.

And when we say ‘platform’, we mean it. Well over 23,500 external partners – and counting – enrich the product base. Data-driven, adventurous (making mistakes is no biggie, as long as learnings are shared), we intend to deliver on our promise to make life easier and more fun for customers. And that is exactly what our 500 IT professionals (25% internationals), who comprise 90+ autonomous Scrum teams, do.</p>\\n<p><strong>The biggest challenge</strong></p>\\n<p>Although our business model may sound familiar, our approach to network retailing sets us apart from the usual suspects. So much so, in fact, that while we admire the achievements of international platforms, we don’t necessarily consider them our peers.

Come help us build our open source community centered around VoIP technology!</em></p>\\n<p>We are looking for a colleague well-versed in networking, community building, and project management to come join our team and help us build our newest endeavor, an open source community. At Devhouse Spindle, we recognize the value and importance of open source software. Whether it’s using existing projects in our VoIP platform VoIPGRID, or open sourcing parts of our Vialer Webphone, we incorporate open source software whenever we can. These efforts led us to notice that the VoIP open source scene is very fragmented. There are various projects and companies working to further open source VoIP technology, but nothing bringing them together. With that in mind, we set out to build the Open VoIP Alliance, a community of projects and companies working together to progress the development of VoIP technology.</p>\\n<p>As our new colleague, you would work to build the structure of the community, as well as build the momentum for it. One of your first duties will be to see what we have already built and come up with creative ways to further our ideas. You would also be our spokesperson and networker, so having experience with that as well as knowledge of the best ways to get others involved is a must. You will also take part in planning and organizing hackathons, meetups, workshops and the like to keep our community active. As an individual, you are organized and enthusiastic. You don’t mind being the person that gets things running and pulls the rest of the team along, but you do value communicating and collaborating with the team and the community. For this role, English is the main communication language, so you must be comfortable communicating in English regularly. Other languages are welcome, but not required.</p>\\n<h2>Your professional profile</h2>\\n<p><em>You:</em></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Have a great command of English, our working language</li>\\n<li>Have experience with community building</li>\\n<li>Have experience working in open source communities</li>\\n<li>Have experience with project management</li>\\n<li>Have your own opinions on running a community</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Bonus points if you:</em></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Have experience with VoIP technology</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>About Spindle</h2>\\n<p>Devhouse Spindle is a growing and ever-changing organization on a mission to connect the world using open and free communication. With almost 60 colleagues, we develop the tools that make this possible such as VoIPGRID, our award winning telefony platform. Alongside that we develop an app (both Android and iOS versions), Webphone, and a browser plugin which allow you to use the VoIP platform wherever you are.</p>\\n<p>Next to the tools we develop, we also connect people through the foundation, 48percent.org and the open source community, the Open VoIP Alliance. Spindle is located in Groningen, a beautiful city known for its innovation and the second fastest growing tech city in the Netherlands.</p>\\n<h2>Working at Spindle</h2>\\n<p>If you look around the office, you’ll notice we do things a bit different around here:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>We organize ourselves using a system called Holacracy. We believe every colleague is able to contribute to the organization rather than relying on a traditional hierarchy. Having no managers comes with extra responsibility to take ownership of your work and set priorities that help to further the organization.</li>\\n<li>We work with a “build, measure, learn” mentality and open mindset. We recognize that not everything you do is going to work right away. We praise experimentation and reward trying something new, even if the lesson is to not try it again.</li>\\n<li>We have an open and transparent salary system. Every colleague is placed in the pathway and a level best fitting their education, experience, and visible behavior. We encourage growth and have clear guidelines and expectations for doing so.</li>\\n<li>We are a diverse and inclusive team of international coworkers. We value the differences that each person brings to the table and think that it\\'s those differences that strengthen our organization.</li>\\n<li>We strongly believe in open source. We show this by open sourcing our code when possible, using other open source projects for our VoIP platform, contributing to projects, and we have even started the Open VoIP Alliance to encourage collaboration when it comes to VoIP open source software.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>What we offer</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A relaxed and welcoming culture with celebrations, events, and trips</li>\\n<li>A competitive salary and good pension benefits</li>\\n<li>An annual study budget and study days for personal and professional growth</li>\\n<li>Two weeks leave when welcoming a new member to the family</li>\\n<li>Other benefits that contribute to your health, well-being, and work/life balance</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Want to know more about this job, the employee benefits, or Spindle?
