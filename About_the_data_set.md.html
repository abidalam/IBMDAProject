    <h2>About the dataset</h2>
    <p>Stack Overflow, a popular website for developers, conducted an online survey of software professionals across the world. The survey data was later open sourced by Stack Overflow. The actual data set has around 90,000 responses.</p>
    <p>The dataset you are going to use in this assignment comes from the following source: <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/04/09/the-2019-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-are-in?cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork-21426264&#x26;cm_mmca1=000026UJ&#x26;cm_mmca2=10006555&#x26;cm_mmca3=M12345678&#x26;cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&#x26;cvo_campaign=000026UJ&#x26;cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork-21426264&#x26;cm_mmca1=000026UJ&#x26;cm_mmca2=10006555&#x26;cm_mmca3=M12345678&#x26;cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&#x26;cvo_campaign=000026UJ" target="_blank" rel="external">https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/04/09/the-2019-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-are-in/</a> under a <strong><a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0?cm_mmc=Email_Newsletter-_-Developer_Ed%2BTech-_-WW_WW-_-SkillsNetwork-Courses-IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork-21426264&#x26;cm_mmca1=000026UJ&#x26;cm_mmca2=10006555&#x26;cm_mmca3=M12345678&#x26;cvosrc=email.Newsletter.M12345678&#x26;cvo_campaign=000026UJ" target="_blank" rel="external">ODbL: Open Database License</a></strong>.</p>
    <p>You will be given a subset of the original data set in this capstone project. You will explore, analyze, and visualize this dataset and present your analysis.</p>
    <p>Note: This randomised subset contains around 1/10th of the original data set. Any conclusions you draw after analyzing this subset may not reflect the real world scenario.</p>
    <p>The dataset is available as a .csv file <a href="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m1_survey_data.csv">here</a>.</p>
