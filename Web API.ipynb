This ability to leverage a variety of tools across the CrowdStrike stack allow us to accomplish our detection goals while balancing local resource utilization and false positives for our customers.\\\\u003c/p\\\\u003e\\\\n\\\\u003cp\\\\u003eAs a sensor engineer within the ECD team you will be focused on the analysis and development of detections for Windows based attack techniques across supported Windows OS versions. You’ll work collaboratively to implement these detections within the Falcon sensor which is a lightweight kernel-level module that observes system activity, recognizes malicious behavior, provides on-box prevention capability, and sends relevant security related data and telemetry to the Falcon cloud. You’ll help develop creative and resourceful ways to detect Windows specific threats while also helping develop cross platform features that cut across core OS subsystems such as analysis of file system, memory, process, and network telemetry. You’ll get exposure to both user-level and kernel-level coding practices.  You’ll collaborate with multiple teams within engineering, and will be expected to make significant contributions to the design and implementation of major development projects.

Our groundbreaking technology, services delivery, and intelligence gathering together with our innovations in machine learning and behavioral-based detection, allow our customers to not only defend themselves, but do so in a future-proof manner. We’ve earned numerous honors and top rankings for our technology, organization and people – clearly confirming our industry leadership and our special culture driving it. We also offer flexible work arrangements to help our people manage their personal and professional lives in a way that works for them. So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.</p>\\n<p><strong>About the Role:</strong></p>\\n<p>Crowdstrike is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join our growing Engine and Content Development (ECD) team which focuses on security related endpoint development on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>\\n<p>The Engine and Content Development team is a central part of CrowdStrike’s mission - “We Stop Breaches.\"  In ECD, we implement strategies and processes that detect suspicious or malicious behavior. Our goal is to automatically stop the bad guys where possible, and to provide useful visibility and guidance to security analysts when new previously unknown adversary activity occurs. We research attacker behavior to understand their tools and techniques, and we build capabilities to detect and prevent malicious activity. Our detection strategies are often performed directly on the endpoint, but are also executed in cloud and may utilize a hybrid strategy combining aspects of both environments.  This ability to leverage a variety of tools across the CrowdStrike stack allow us to accomplish our detection goals while balancing local resource utilization and false positives for our customers.</p>\\n<p>As a sensor engineer within the ECD team you will be focused on the analysis and development of detections for Windows based attack techniques across supported Windows OS versions. You’ll work collaboratively to implement these detections within the Falcon sensor which is a lightweight kernel-level module that observes system activity, recognizes malicious behavior, provides on-box prevention capability, and sends relevant security related data and telemetry to the Falcon cloud. You’ll help develop creative and resourceful ways to detect Windows specific threats while also helping develop cross platform features that cut across core OS subsystems such as analysis of file system, memory, process, and network telemetry. You’ll get exposure to both user-level and kernel-level coding practices.  You’ll collaborate with multiple teams within engineering, and will be expected to make significant contributions to the design and implementation of major development projects.

He or she will drive the technical evolution of our IoT sensor data pipeline and support our customer-facing web applications and data analysis tools. Clarity is a globally distributed organization with headquarters in Oakland, CA.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our Company:</strong></p>\\n<p>At Clarity, we strive to empower the world to reduce air pollution. We do that by making it accessible for cities and industries to measure and understand their air pollution issues and take effective action.</p>\\n<p>Today, when cities and industrial facilities want to measure air quality at a site they have to purchase expensive monitoring equipment and invest even more to install it in container-sized shelters and integrate its measurements into their IT system. This is unacceptable because it leads to the inability to monitor air pollution at important sites and ultimately to the inability to manage air pollution.</p>\\n<p>We envision a world where novel sensing technology, IoT and cloud computing simplify air quality measurement, enabling cities and industrial facilities to scale up the number of monitoring sites and take data-driven action. Our Sensing-as-a-Service solution for air quality is currently deployed in over 70 cities across 30+ countries and is changing how municipalities and industrial facilities monitor their air quality.</p>\\n<p>After successfully raising our Series A (a few words from our investors here and here), we are excited to keep building on our current success elevating our product to the next level, at the forefront of the clean air movement. This is especially true of our software products, where we see a significant opportunity to increase the value we provide to our customers as well as to expand the number of use cases supported by our Sensing-as-a-Service solution.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our Team:</strong></p>\\n<p>We are a diverse group of engineers, scientists, and makers from all around the world who are passionate about what we do and devoted to our mission to improve the world by solving some of its greatest challenges. We believe in solving challenging problems by adopting a growth mindset, by fostering an environment that encourages deep collaboration, empathy, and creativity, and by keeping a good sense of humor. We enjoy philosophical debates as much as nerding out about the soldering talents of our HW engineers or the cool data visualizations we create. Although we always have our mission in mind, we know the path for any startup has ups and downs and we’re more than happy to face them together as a team. How else could you tackle a problem as complex and global as air pollution?</p>\\n<p><strong>Job Description:</strong></p>\\n<p>We are seeking a highly self-motivated and passionate backend developer with a proven track record in delivering top-quality code and architectural solutions to bring our Clarity Cloud to the next level.

You will enjoy freedom of action around these topics and be encouraged to take initiative for making our software offerings truly revolutionary in the clean-tech space. You will have plenty of opportunity to work closely with our customers and end-users who hail from industry, government, NGOs, community groups, and academia.

       "  'description': '<p>Hi,</p>\\n<p>We’re hiring a software engineer because we need your expertise and experience\\nto help us accomplish <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/3d654bf2be1d48be92ca6ee8ccbb65ba\">our mission</a>\\nas a company. That mission is to help our clients grow their company so they\\ncan focus on solving big problems in the world.</p>\\n<p>See, we believe that humans are built to make things. And one of the best ways\\nto get more people making more things, is to help them sell their products and\\nservices they invent.</p>\\n<p>We know how to do that over and over again.</p>\\n<p><strong>That’s why our mission is helping our clients grow their revenue by <em>$100\\nmillion per year</em>. It’s a measure of the impact we’re having and how effective\\nwe are as a company.</strong></p>\\n<p>And that is where you come in!</p>\\n<p>We’ve maxed out what our small Engineering team (myself and 2 part-time\\ncontractors) can do. We need your help to level our team up. You will not just\\nbe slotted in somewhere. You are our second full time developer hire. You will\\nhelp me set the culture and direction of our team from here on out. I need\\nsomeone to work collaboratively with so both of us can do better work than\\nwe’ve ever done before.</p>\\n<p><strong>We’re a different kind of software development team.</strong></p>\\n<p>First, you’ll ship. Our #1 KPI’s involve shipping. No endless rounds of review.\\nNo abandoned projects 80% of the way through. What you build will be used by\\nreal people. How?</p>\\n<p>No made up features. We think from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Harris_Bryan/status/1296782480746438656\">first principles</a>\\nand solve problems. We don’t invent random stuff and don’t have “pet features”.\\nNo one comes down from on high with “the next great idea” that no one actually\\nwants to use (or build).</p>\\n<p>Everything you build will solve a real problem for ourselves and/or our users.</p>\\n<p>Next, we are anti-code monkeys.</p>\\n<p>We know it’s imperative that you understand how and why people use what we\\nbuild. You aren’t handed a spec and sent off to build. You’ll be involved early\\non when shaping a project and uncovering the real problem we’re trying to\\nsolve. Then, we work forward as a team to invent the best possible way on Earth\\nto solve that problem.</p>\\n<p>Lastly, we avoid red tape and bureaucracy. Think a new design pattern will be\\nreally effective? Discovered a new library that can help us move faster? Want\\nto adopt a new process or best practice? Let’s do it! You’ll help us constantly\\nimprove through quick experiments and no dogma.</p>\\n<p>What this means day-to-day:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Spend 80-90% of your time developing software. Solving product problems. Writing code. Reviewing PRs. Hands dirty. Shipping.</li>\\n<li>Asynchronous communication by default. Have a record of what we want to do and why. Give ourselves the space to work deeply.</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>What this means in the medium/long term:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Work directly with me, Director of Engineering, to continue shaping our engineering team. Make what’s working better and fix what not (or has stopped) working in our culture and processes.</li>\\n<li>Potential to grow into a leader as we expand the team further (expecting 6 more full time engineers in the next 18 months).</li>\\n<li>Truly, doing your best work by mainly getting out of your way, removing roadblock, and letting you be awesome!</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>In summary, your core areas of focus for this role will be:</p>\\n<p>Software development: code, style, build. Problem solving: product development,\\nidentify and solve real-world problems. Project management: organize your work\\nand help organize the team. Create Stories/To Do items for yourself and others\\nas needs arise.</p>\\n<h2>What will you learn in this role?</h2>\\n<p>If you come from a large enterprise experience, you may be accustomed to long\\nroadmaps and even longer meetings. You may be used to waiting for weeks to\\nmonths to get approval to try something new. You may feel like a small cog in a\\nvery large machine. We’re pretty much the opposite. You will learn to work\\nquickly on small timelines. Instead of “We’ll add that to the end of our 3 year\\nroadmap.” We think “How can we solve this in the next few weeks?” and “Can we\\nsimplify and ship quicker?”</p>\\n<p>If you come from a more of a startup background, you’ll feel right more at\\nhome. You will wear many hats and sometimes be called to help in areas that may\\nnot be explicitly in your core areas. You will also learn that adding a little\\ndiscipline and structure to processes can actually increase productivity and\\nenable more alignment.</p>\\n<p>In this role you will learn:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>How to avoid the knee-jerk “Ok, I can build that” response and instead dig a little deeper to get to the true root problem to be solved.</li>\\n<li>How to collaborate on software that the entire team owns. We all are responsible for everything.</li>\\n<li>How just the right amount of upfront planning creates a controlled, yet fast, environment where we can ship more rapidly than others expect.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Who will you work with?</h2>\\n<p>You will work directly with me, Chris Marshall, the Director of Engineering.\\nYou will be the second full time engineer on the team (after me). We also have\\na part-time designer and front-end engineer. They will be on our weekly calls\\nand you’ll work closely with each of them.</p>\\n<p>For the first 3 to 6 months, we will be the only two full-time folks on the\\nteam. During 2021, our plan is to continue to build the team to 8 full-time\\nengineers by the end of Q1 2022. During that time we’ll split into 2 or more\\nmin-teams and you’ll be given the opportunity to lead one of those should you\\nchoose.</p>\\n<p>You’ll also interact with all of our other core team members on a regular basis\\nduring weekly company calls and when we build internal tools for others within\\nthe company.</p>\\n<h2>Where will you work?</h2>\\n<p>We all work remotely and are scattered around North America from Vancouver to\\nCleveland, and Nashville to Birmingham. That means you have the flexibility to\\nwork from home or a coworking location, or to take the family to Peru for the\\nsummer and work from your terrace overlooking the Andes Mountains.</p>\\n<p>We don’t micromanage you. Rather, we expect you to be responsible for yourself.\\nShow up for meetings on-time and communicate proactively. Working hours are\\ngenerally flexible and the work you do is more important than the number of\\nhours you work (in fact we actively discourage long hours and working on the\\nweekends).</p>\\n<h2>What does Growth Tools do and why?</h2>\\n<p>Growth Tools provides the tools and training to help online businesses double\\ntheir revenue in 1 year. Our tools consist of 10 SaaS products that we give\\naway for free. Our training programs consist of a 1:1 coaching business, Growth\\nUniversity,</p>\\n<p>We believe that the world is a better place when people create and those\\ncreations are shared.</p>\\n<p>Example: I looooove Allbird shoes.</p>\\n<p>Guess how Allbirds came to exist? A dude, Tim Brown, had the idea for them. And\\nhe had enough gumption and know-how to go out and actually make them. Now\\nAllbirds is one of the most successful upstart shoe brands from the past 5\\nyears.</p>\\n<p>The world is a better place when every Tim out there turns their ideas into\\nreal-life products.</p>\\n<p>That’s why our goal is to generate $100 million in revenue for our clients.\\nThat is our measurement that these creations are being shared and real value is\\nbeing generated as a result.</p>\\n<p>Do you want to be on the front lines and directly involved with growing some of\\nthe coolest and most innovative companies in the world and shaping one of the\\nbest engineering teams in the world?</p>\\n<p>If you are interested in solving challenging problems with software and\\nbuilding amazing and innovative products with me, I can’t wait to talk to\\nyou!</p>\\n<p>-- Chris</p>\\n<p>P.S.
